## Getting Started

To use the Cold Email Blocker, click on the `Cold Email Blocker` tab in the left sidebar. Or visit [this link](https://mailto.live/cold-email-blocker).

You can run the cold email blocker in three modes:

1. **List here**: This will display the cold emails in the table below.

2. **Auto label**: This will automatically label the cold emails in your inbox with the label `Cold Email`, and display the cold emails in the table below.

3. **Auto archive and label**: This will automatically archive the cold emails in your inbox and label them with the label `Cold Email`, and display the cold emails in the table below.

Cold email processing will only apply to new emails. It will not process emails that have already been processed.[​](https://docs.getinboxzero.com/essentials/cold-email-blocker#custom-prompts)
Custom Prompts

You can adjust the prompt we use to mark an email as a cold email. To do this, click the `Edit Prompt` button and adjust the prompt to your liking. We recommend using a similar format to the existing prompt by giving examples of what you do and don’t consider a cold email.


Testing
-------

To test how well the cold email blocker is working, click the `Test` button. A side panel will open, and you can paste in an email to see if it would be marked as a cold email. You can also test previous emails that appear in the side panel.[​](https://docs.getinboxzero.com/essentials/cold-email-blocker#how-we-classify-cold-emails)
How we classify cold emails

We classify your email based on the prompt that is set. By default you don’t need to set any prompt and we’ll use our own. This should work for most people, but you can adjust it to better fit your needs if you like.

If a user has emailed you in the past, we do not consider this a cold email. Our AI won’t run in these cases.[
